# Image-Classification-using-CNN

# Description

I have created a  Image Classifier which can distinguish whether a given pic is of a dog or cat or something else depending upon fed data. I have used a machine learning algorithms out there which is used for Image Classification i.e. Convolutional Neural Network(or CNN).
 CNN â€“ as we know its a machine learning algorithm for machines to understand the features of the image with foresight and remember the features to guess whether the name of the new image fed to the machine.
